		At the Company where our friend's Alemneh works, there is a use of tablets by employees to perform their daily tasks. Employees grab tablets from a tablet station as they need. This leads to some issues such as broken and stolen tablets and lack of accountability. We are trying to solve this problem by creating a website which employees would need to use to check out and return tablets. Additionally, the supervisors would be able to use the website to do inventory each week by seeing which tablets were check out by whom, as well as how long they were checked out for. We believe that our project will be very useful for small companies to manage their employee equipment. The website we built is very convenient and easy use, it doesn't require any additional training for employee to use the website. Knowing the basics of computer and smartphone technologies enough to access our website. Small business employers can use our service to avoid the loss of high cost devices. Additionally, our website will make sure that employees are accountable for the device they used when they perform their daily task.
